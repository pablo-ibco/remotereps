## Quick Start

### üöÄ One-Command Setup (Recommended)

The system now includes complete automation. Just run:

```bash
./run_all.sh
```

This single command will:
1. ‚úÖ Create `.env` file from `.env.example` if needed
2. ‚úÖ Set up virtual environment if needed
3. ‚úÖ Install all Python dependencies
4. ‚úÖ Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
5. ‚úÖ Wait for services to be ready
6. ‚úÖ Run database migrations
7. ‚úÖ Create admin user (admin/admin123)
8. ‚úÖ Start Django server, Celery worker, and Celery beat
9. ‚úÖ Display access URLs and credentials

### üìä Access the System

After running `./run_all.sh`, you can access:

- **Django Admin**: http://localhost:8000/admin
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`
- **Django Server**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Endpoints**: http://localhost:8000/api/
- **Swagger Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/api/docs

### üîß Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control, you can run setup steps individually:

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
./setup.sh

# 2. Start all services
./run_all.sh
```

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Options

The system supports both PostgreSQL (recommended) and SQLite:

#### PostgreSQL (Docker - Default)
- Automatically configured in `docker-compose.yml`
- Production-ready with proper indexing
- Concurrent access support

#### SQLite (Local)
- Edit `.env` and set: `DB_ENGINE=django.db.backends.sqlite3`
- Remove database variables to use SQLite defaults
- Good for development and testing

---

## Data Models

### Core Entities
- **Brand**: name, daily_budget, monthly_budget
- **Campaign**: belongs to Brand, has status (active/paused), daily/monthly spend tracking, pause reason
- **Spend**: campaign, amount, date, type (daily/monthly), description
- **Schedule**: campaign, day_of_week, start_time, end_time, is_active

### Relationships
- Brands have multiple campaigns
- Campaigns belong to one brand
- Campaigns have multiple spends and schedules
- All models include audit fields (created_at, updated_at)

See [PSEUDOCODE.md](./PSEUDOCODE.md) for a high-level, language-agnostic overview and business logic.

---

## Admin Panel Usage

### Access
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000/admin
- **Credentials**: admin / admin123

### Management Features
- **Brands**: Create/edit brands and set daily/monthly budgets
- **Campaigns**: Assign to brands, set status, view spend, pause/activate campaigns
- **Spends**: View all spend records, filter by campaign/brand/date, add manual spends
- **Schedules**: Set dayparting rules (days/times when campaigns are allowed to run)
- **Visual Indicators**: All models have color-coded budget/spend indicators for quick status assessment

### Key Admin Actions
- Monitor budget vs spend in real-time
- Manually pause/activate campaigns
- Add emergency spends or budget adjustments
- Configure dayparting schedules
- View system logs and audit trails

---

## Management Commands

Run with `python manage.py <command>`

### Budget Enforcement
Pauses campaigns that exceed daily/monthly budgets:
```bash
python manage.py enforce_budgets
```

### Dayparting Enforcement
Pauses/activates campaigns based on their schedule:
```bash
python manage.py enforce_dayparting
```

### Spend Reset
Resets daily/monthly spends and reactivates eligible campaigns:
```bash
# Daily reset
python manage.py reset_spends --daily

# Monthly reset
python manage.py reset_spends --monthly

# Both daily and monthly
python manage.py reset_spends --both
```

### Example Output
```
INFO Starting budget enforcement
INFO Budget enforcement completed: {'checked': 2, 'paused_daily': 1, 'paused_monthly': 0, 'errors': 0}
```

---

## Celery Tasks & Health Check

Celery automates all enforcement and reset operations. Tasks are scheduled via Celery Beat.

### Scheduled Tasks
- **Budget enforcement**: Every 5 minutes
- **Dayparting enforcement**: Every minute
- **Daily reset**: Every day at 00:00 UTC
- **Monthly reset**: 1st day of month at 00:00 UTC

### Health Check
Check system health (database, campaigns, services):
```bash
python manage.py shell -c "from tasks.budget_tasks import health_check_task; print(health_check_task())"
```

### Example Health Check Output
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-06-26T21:54:39Z",
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": {
    "database": {"status": "healthy", "connection": "ok"},
    "campaigns": {"status": "healthy", "active": 5, "paused": 2},
    "services": {"status": "healthy", "celery": "running", "redis": "connected"}
  }
}
```

---

## Static Typing & Testing

### Type Safety
- All code uses Python type hints (PEP 484)
- MyPy configuration: `mypy.ini`
- Zero type errors enforced

### Type Checking
```bash
mypy .
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
./run_tests.sh

# Run specific test modules
python manage.py test brands
python manage.py test campaigns
python manage.py test spending
python manage.py test scheduling

# Run system integration test
python test_system.py

# Run API tests
python manage.py test test_api_endpoints
```

---

## Daily & Monthly Workflow

### Automated Process
1. **Every minute**: Dayparting enforcement (pauses/activates campaigns by schedule)
2. **Every 5 minutes**: Budget enforcement (pauses campaigns that exceed budgets)
3. **00:00 daily**: Resets daily spends, reactivates eligible campaigns
4. **00:00 on 1st of month**: Resets monthly spends, reactivates eligible campaigns

### Manual Actions
- All automated actions can be triggered manually via management commands
- Admin panel provides real-time control and monitoring
- Emergency overrides available for urgent situations

---

## Assumptions & Simplifications

### System Design
- All times are UTC for consistency
- Spending is tracked with cent precision (2 decimal places)
- No real-time notifications (comprehensive logging instead)
- PostgreSQL by default, with SQLite fallback
- REST API available for integration
- Celery + Redis for background task processing

### Business Rules
- Budgets are soft limits (can be exceeded with manual intervention)
- Dayparting is enforced automatically
- Campaign status changes are logged for audit
- No automatic budget increases or alerts

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Services Not Starting
```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Restart containers
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs postgres
docker-compose logs redis
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database status
python manage.py dbshell

# Reset database (WARNING: loses data)
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Celery Issues
```bash
# Check Celery status
celery -A budget_system inspect active

# Restart Celery
pkill -f celery
./run_all.sh
```

#### Port Conflicts
- **Port 8000**: Change in `run_all.sh` or stop other Django servers
- **Port 5432**: Stop local PostgreSQL (`brew services stop postgresql`)
- **Port 6379**: Stop local Redis (`brew services stop redis`)

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
./run_all.sh
```
