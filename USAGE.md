## How the System Works

### Automatic Budget Enforcement

The system automatically monitors spending and pauses campaigns when they exceed budgets:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Campaign Active] --> B{Check Budgets}
    B -->|Under Budget| C[Keep Active]
    B -->|Over Daily Budget| D[Pause Campaign]
    B -->|Over Monthly Budget| E[Pause Campaign]
    D --> F[Set Reason: Daily Budget Exceeded]
    E --> G[Set Reason: Monthly Budget Exceeded]
    F --> H[Log Action]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Wait for Reset]
```

**Example Scenario:**
- Brand has $100 daily budget
- Campaign spends $25 â†’ Still active
- Campaign spends another $80 â†’ Total $105 â†’ **Automatically paused**
- System logs: "Paused campaign due to daily budget limit"

### Dayparting Enforcement

The system respects campaign schedules and only allows campaigns to run during specified hours:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Check Current Time] --> B{Within Schedule?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Allow Campaign]
    B -->|No| D[Pause Campaign]
    D --> E[Set Reason: Outside Schedule]
    C --> F[Check Budgets]
    F --> G{Under Budget?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Keep Active]
    G -->|No| I[Pause Campaign]
```

**Example Scenario:**
- Campaign scheduled for Monday 9 AM - 6 PM
- Current time: Monday 2 PM â†’ **Campaign active**
- Current time: Monday 8 PM â†’ **Campaign automatically paused**

### Daily and Monthly Resets

The system automatically resets spending and reactivates eligible campaigns:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Daily Reset - 00:00] --> B[Reset Daily Spend to 0]
    B --> C[Check All Paused Campaigns]
    C --> D{Can Be Activated?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Activate Campaign]
    D -->|No| F[Keep Paused]
    
    G[Monthly Reset - 1st of Month] --> H[Reset Monthly Spend to 0]
    H --> I[Check All Paused Campaigns]
    I --> J{Can Be Activated?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Activate Campaign]
    J -->|No| L[Keep Paused]
```

**Example Scenario:**
- Campaign paused due to daily budget exceeded
- 00:00 next day â†’ Daily spend reset to $0
- System checks: Under budget? âœ“ Within schedule? âœ“
- **Campaign automatically reactivated**

## Real-World Usage Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Brand

**Setup:**
- **Brand**: "TechStore"
- **Daily Budget**: $500
- **Monthly Budget**: $10,000
- **Campaigns**: "Black Friday Sale", "Holiday Special"
- **Schedule**: Monday-Friday 8 AM - 8 PM

**Workflow:**
1. System tracks spending throughout the day
2. If spending reaches $500 â†’ campaigns automatically paused
3. Next day at 00:00 â†’ spending reset, campaigns reactivated
4. Outside business hours â†’ campaigns automatically paused
5. During business hours â†’ campaigns active (if under budget)

### Example 2: Local Restaurant

**Setup:**
- **Brand**: "Pizza Palace"
- **Daily Budget**: $50
- **Monthly Budget**: $1,000
- **Campaigns**: "Lunch Special", "Dinner Delivery"
- **Schedule**: Tuesday-Sunday 11 AM - 10 PM

**Workflow:**
1. Monday â†’ All campaigns automatically paused (closed day)
2. Tuesday 11 AM â†’ campaigns automatically activated
3. If daily spend reaches $50 â†’ campaigns paused
4. Next day â†’ reset and reactivate
